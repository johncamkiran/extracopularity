# Extracopularity in 3D particle packings

Code for computing *extracopularity coefficients* in three-dimensional particle packings.

The current version performs "bond angle discretization" as per [2] if a "commonly encountered geometry" cannot be found as per [1]. A version that adheres strictly to [1] is preserved in the legacy branch.

For documentation, see the header comment of the file extracopularity.m
